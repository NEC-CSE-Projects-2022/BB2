## Abstract
Fire incidents demand rapid, reliable detection. Existing vision-based methods suffer high false alarms, poor generalization, and high computational costs. YOLO-HF, a compact YOLOv5s variant, integrates four lightweight modules for efficient fire and smoke detection in limited-resource settings. The system’s real-time alert pipeline enables swift response.On 6,500 annotated images, YOLO-HF achieves mAP@0.5 of 0.958, outperforming baselines and reducing false alarms through threshold tuning. YOLO-HF’s novelty is its tailored module combination for fire/smoke cues and deployment-ready alerting, balancing accuracy and speed for practical use.
